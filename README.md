# Case-Client-Management-System
Demo version of Case & Client Management System, designed for law firms.

A tiny project I did during my Y1 summer vacation
This is a demo frontend version of a Client & Case Management System, originally developed with Supabase as the backend.
The system was designed to meet the needs of a law firm, with a focus on powerful search, flexible customization, and bilingual support.
All backend keys and sensitive data have been removed for security reasons.

Features:

Powerful Search Engine – Search by client name, ID, case reference, or keywords across custom notes.

Flexible Fields – Lawyers can add custom attributes (e.g., client personality, case reminders, progress notes).

Bilingual Fields – Support for both English and Chinese client/case records.

Separated Client & Case Management – Keep client profiles and case files distinct but linked.

Case Type Templates – Different case categories (e.g., Conveyancing, Litigation, Tenancy) with tailored fields such as Buyer/Seller, Landlord/Tenant, or Plaintiff/Defendant.

Future Integration – Planned calendar/meeting feature for scheduling and deadlines.
